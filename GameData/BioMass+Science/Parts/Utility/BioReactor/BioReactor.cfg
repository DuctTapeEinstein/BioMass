    description = Based on biofuel designs in use at the end of the war, the bioreactor is a space-ready, state-of-the-art gassifier reactor and refinery. The hardy microorganisms growing on the specially constructed interior surfaces generate a series of intermediate compounds that even scientists find boring to keep track of. Let's just say that biocake goes in and liquid fuel comes out...along with oxygen, and sometimes water.
