    description = Based on biofuel designs in use at the end of the war, the bioreactor is a space-ready, state-of-the-art hydrothermal liquefaction and catalytic hydrothermal gasification reactor and refinery. A combination of high temperature and pressure, coupled with extremophile microorganisms growing on the specially constructed interior surfaces generate a series of intermediate compounds that even scientists find boring to keep track of. Let's just say that biocake goes in and liquid fuel comes out...along with gasses and sometimes water.
