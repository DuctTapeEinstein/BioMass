title =  O2 Gas Compressor
manufacturer = Stodola, LLC.
description = Originally conceived as a medical device to provide oxygen to patients at rates far greater than natural, and thus speed recovery, initial tests did not show positive outcomes for patients. Unwilling to abandon the R&D investment, Stodola, LLC offered it to the KSP, which gladly accepted the technology to convert oxygen to oxidizer and back again.
//description = In the process of working on ways to keep snacks refreshingly cool even on the hottest days, Stodola discovered that they could cool things to such a degree that they could fractionate and seperate gasses, which could then be compressed and stored.
