    description = While not as picturesque as a greenhouse full of flowering plants, a fully functional algae bioreactor is a colour that Kerbals find immensely attractive. In addition to be aesthetically pleasing, the bioreactor nurtures kamboo, a fast growing plant that grows as a flowing plant above water, and as an algae-like organism when immersed in water. Specially bred to germinate only in the presence of light, and reproduce in the dark, kamboo is the ideal plant for closed systems. The bioreactor maintains kamboo in it's aquatic form to effeciently clean water, scrub carbon dixoide from the air, produce oxygen, and do so all with a very pleasant scent. The bioreactor comes with a built in filter and polytron unit for the efficient harvesting of the biomass and seeds for use in making other useful materials, like snacks and fuel.
