  description = Based on biofuel designs in use at the end of the war, the biofuel refinery is space-ready. Combining oil and ethanol in this vat, and kept at a specific temperature though the use of heating coils, liquid fuel, oxygen, and glycerol are produced. Only one of those is immediately useful in making things go, though.
