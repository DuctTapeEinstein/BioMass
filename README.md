BioMass Science+... Updated 27.11.13

Creators:

Science = seanth

Models = Roboto


Notes:

All parts should now show up in career mode, but for the time being it is not recommended that the mod be used in career mode. We are still testing and fiddling with parts, so if any major changes end up being made it could break your career mode craft. I suggest playing with it in sandbox for now to help us tweak and bug hunt.

===========================================================================================
BioMass Mod for KSP

Modular Greenhouses for cultivating photosynthetic organisms that can be consumed in
a Bio-Mass Reactor to produce standard, yet renewable fuel types!

2 New Bio-fuel greenhouses. There is now one for each of the standard fuels.

Edited model skins and color coded them for easy identification.

Created all new parts config files

Removed GLite resource, and changed the way the modules work altogether.

Updated for KSP 0.21, Fixed file structure

Greenhouses / Bio-Mass Reactors

Each module cultivates a different kind of photosynthetic organism to later be converted into fuel by the Bio-Mass Reactor.

Bio-Mass production occurs predominantly in direct sunlight.

**Subsystem Always Active**
Life Support Systems are active at all times to maintain an adequate Biosphere for your photosynthetic organisms, while providing consistent, but small amount of Bio-Mass growth.

** Subsystem Must be activated**
The Supplementary Power Subsystem can be activated to increase Bio-Mass productivity, or to replace sunlight when it is blocked.

** Subsystem Must be activated**
The Bio-Mass Reactor Subsystem uses electric charge to convert stored Bio-Mass into fuel.
