BioMass Mod for KSP

Modular Greenhouses for cultivating photosynthetic organisms that can be consumed in
a Bio-Mass Reactor to produce standard, yet renewable fuel types!

Created all new parts config files

Removed GLite resource, and changed the way the modules work altogether.

Updated for KSP 0.21, Fixed file structure

Greenhouses:
   Greenhouses start devoid of life. Transfer seeds into the greenhouses and expose the seeds to light. They will germinate into biomass.

   If there is light CO2 and water present, the biomass will grow, producing more biomass and releasing oxygen.

   In the absence of light biomass will consume oxygen and reduce in mass, releasing CO2 and water. It will also produce seeds.

   Using waste water in the greenhouses will increase biomass growth rates and help produce clean water.

   Greenhouses have a harvester mechanism which harvests biomass into biocake, which can the used in either the BioReactor of the Koylent maker.

Koylent maker:
   The koylent maker takes biocake and seeds and turns it into food for your kerbals.

BioReactor:
   The bioreactor is where biocake is fermented and combined with other gasses to produce liquid fuel, and gasses such as CO2, H2 and O2.

Composter:
   The composter allows you to degrade practically anything (even liquid fuel) to either CO2 and H2, or Kethane and O2.

Cryogenic air seperator:
    This handy device will take atmospheric gasses (though a jet-engine air intake) and break it into it's constituant components (O2, CO2, H2, Kethane, Xenon...). These gasses can then be stored for later use

Compressors:
    The H2, O2 and CO2 compressors will allow you you compress gasses to save space or make much needed fuels (O2-->oxidizer, H2-->monopropellant)

Sciencers:
    Use the BioScience parts to add to your science research bounty.
